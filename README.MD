# BSpline Demo

**PARTIALLY WORKABLE**

A demo showing the spline curve from interpolating points using my [BSpline Interpolation library](https://github.com/12ff54e/BsplineInterpolation.git). Drawing is implemented using Emscripten's porting of OpenGL.

You can click on canvas of the [webpage](https://12ff54e.github.io/BSplineDemo) to add points and these points will be interpolated with a 2nd order BSpline. Filling can be toggled by pressing F key.
